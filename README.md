My final project for a Basic Web Design class taken at Plattsburgh State, completed in December 2025.

The website can be viewed [here.](https://ty-belcher.github.io/)

The website's purpose is to act as an overall portfolio for various projects I have created across multiple formats, including paintings for another class, concepts for new alphabets, and one short song created especially for the site. My original plan was to go for an "earthy" color scheme, with colors like sky blue, green, brown, gray, and white. The green at the top of the page would have transitioned into the sky blue at the bottom of the page through the use of a gradient. During our first design critique, I was informed that my typography choices, although looked stylish and unique, were deemed difficult to read. The additional bright colors weren't doing the website any justice, either. Others also noted that the overall structure was very reminiscent of early websites from the late 1990s to early 2000s, which, thankfully, was a design choice that I was going for. Soon afterwards, I decided to come up with a different color scheme and font choices, and ditched the bright colors in favor of dark blues and small hints of yellow for simple text. My main inspiration for this change was the PlayStation 2's menu, something I enjoyed for its calmness and simplicity. This alternative approach garnered much more favorability.
