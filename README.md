# web-design-final
My final project for a Basic Web Design class taken at Plattsburgh State, completed in December 2025.

(reserve spot for link here)

The website's purpose is to act as an overall portfolio for various projects I have created across multiple formats, including paintings, concepts for new alphabets, and one short song created especially for the site. My original plan was to go for an "earthy" color scheme, with colors like sky blue, green, brown, gray, and white. The green at the top of the page would have transitioned into the sky blue at the bottom of the page through the use of a gradient. During our first critique, I was informed that my typography choices, although looked stylish, were deemed hard to read. The bright colors used weren't doing the website any justics, either. Others also noted that the overall structure was very reminiscent of early websites from the late 1990s to early 2000s, which, thankfully, was what I was going for. Afterwards, I decided to change course from a color scheme with many bright colors to a darker color scheme with mostly blues and a small usage of yellow. This time, I was inspiered by the design choices used for the menu for the PlayStation 2. This approach garnered much more postive feedback.
